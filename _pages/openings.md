## Future Members

<div class="largefont">
We have multiple opennings for new Postdocs, Ph.D. students, Master students and undergraduate students to join our Group.

### A letter to future members: 

<div class="largefont">
Pursuing a degree or solving scientific problems may require years of commitment. Thus, I truly believe that building a great working culture is the most important thing in our group, definitely more important than publications themselves. In fact, one of the secret sauces for Googleâ€™s decade-long success is its culture. 

we strive to build a unique working culture that is: 

* **Friendly:** treating every member with mutual respects is the minimal requirement. At InspiringGroup, we, including myself, are all friends. 

* **Supportive:** we are here to help and support each other. As a team, we will go through all ups and downs during the process.
 
If you are willing to explore new things and work with a group of compassionate people (or you just want to learn how to apply for Top Universities and Companies abroad), feel free to shoot [[me]](./team) an email.

### To Post-Doc Applicants: 

<div class="largefont">
Our group has unlimitted quotas for Post-Docs. Besides all the benefits provided by Tsinghua, our group will provide an **additional 200,000 to 300,000 RMB annual compenstation** to outstanding applicants. Feel free to send [[me]](./team) an email for subsequent discussions.
