## Future Members

<div class="largefont">
We have multiple opennings for new Ph.D. students, Postdocs, Master students and undergraduate students to join our Group. Our group is well funded. 
</div>

### A letter to future members: 

<div class="largefont">
Pursuing a degree or solving scientific problems may require years of commitment. Thus, I truly believe that building a great working culture is the most important thing in our group, definitely more important than publications themselves. In fact, one of the secret sauces for Googleâ€™s decade-long success is its culture. 

At [InspiringGroup](.), we strive to build a unique working culture that is: 

* **Friendly:** treating every member with mutual respects is the minimal requirement. At InspiringGroup, we, including myself, are all friends. 

* **Supportive:** we are here to help and support each other. As a team, we will go through all ups and downs during the process.

* **Flourishing:** ultimately, I hope every group member will be flourishing, becoming not only academically successful, but also more mature and well-prepared as a person.
 
If you are willing to explore new things and work with a group of compassionate people (or you just want to learn how to apply for Top Universities and Companies abroad), feel free to shoot [[me]](./team) an email. 
</div>

### A second letter to applicants: 

<div class="largefont">
Due to the limitation of quotas on degree-earning Ph.D./master students, I cannot include each of the outstanding applicants as my graduate students here at Tsinghua. Yet, I maintain mutliple research groups with both Tsinghua and non-Tsinghua students on each of the topics I listed [here](./research). If you want to join these groups, also shoot [[me]](./team) an email to explicitly state your interests. 
</div>

### To Post-Doc Applicants: 

<div class="largefont">
Our group has unlimitted quotas for Post-Docs. Besides all the benefits provided by Tsinghua, our group will provide an **additional 200,000 to 300,000 RMB annual compenstation** to outstanding applicants. Feel free to send [[me]](./team) an email for subsequent discussions.
